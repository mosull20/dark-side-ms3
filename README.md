## UX

### Project Goals

This site is aimed at fans of the horror genre and any potential fans that may be interested in discovering books, movies and tv shows recommended by other fans. 

As a site owner, I want to provide a clear, easy to navigate, intuitive site that users will enjoy visiting and find everything they want easily. I want to give access to reviews so users can read the info and navigate through much of the site content without having to create an account first. I also want to encourage users to engage more with the site and add their own title and reviews to share with the horror fan community. They do this by creating a private secure account so they can upload their own reviews, and have control over content they have added in the future with the ability to update or delete any reviews they have added.
