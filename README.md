## UX

### Project Goals

This site is aimed at fans of the horror genre and any potential fans that may be interested in discovering books, movies and tv shows recommended by other fans. 

As a site owner, I want to provide a clear, easy to navigate, intuitive site that users will enjoy visiting and find everything they want easily. I want to give access to reviews so users can read the info and navigate through much of the site content without having to create an account first. I also want to encourage users to engage more with the site and add their own title and reviews to share with the horror fan community. They do this by creating a private secure account so they can upload their own reviews, and have control over content they have added in the future with the ability to update or delete any reviews they have added.

### Code

* Jquery code to resolve issue with no validation on Materialize select element taken directly from Code Institute course work, 'Materialize Form Validation' from the Mini Project video content
* In using the dropdown menu feature in the navbar from materialize, I found it would only target either the main navbar or the collapsible sidenav and not both at the same time. Found an assist to a solution [here](https://pretagteam.com/question/materialize-navbar-dropdownsidebar-dropdown-wont-work-together) which suggested using two copies of the same ul, one to target main navbar, one to target collapsible side navbar. 
* Having issues using Materialize modal for confirming with user before deleting a review, issue was with targeting the correct review, solution to use the jinja templating value of the review id in the href and id found on slack (project-milestone-3 channel)
* Solve to preserve image aspect ratio and resize images for user uploaded image urls found on stack overflow [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12991351/css-force-image-resize-and-keep-aspect-ratio)
